### K8s | Docker | Terraform | Ansible | Codebuild | CodePipeline | CodeDeploy 

## Project Overview
This project showcases AWS-native DevOps for a Node.js application, focusing on automated CI/CD, cloud-native infrastructure, and scalable deployments. The application was containerized and deployed on EKS, leveraging AWS DevOps services and infrastructure-as-code to ensure reliability, efficiency, and maintainability.

Key DevOps practices implemented:

- Containerization with Docker
- Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform
- Configuration management using Ansible
- CI/CD pipelines with CodeBuild, CodePipeline & CodeDeploy
- Kubernetes (EKS) orchestration and scaling
- Monitoring & alerting with CloudWatch
- Blue-Green and Canary deployment strategies
